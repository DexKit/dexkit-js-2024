In the [previous post](https://dexkit.com/no-code-low-code-revolution-transforming-digital-creation/), we explored no-code/low-code platforms. We examined how they make app development practical and cost-effective. In this article, we’ll compare WordPress and Wix, both no-code/low-code platforms designed for Web 2 website creation. Additionally, we’ll show how the DexAppBuilder platform, specific to Web3, differs from them.

WordPress or Wix? If you want to build your project on Web3, the answer to this question is: **DexAppBuilder**. WordPress and Wix are platforms developed for the Web2 environment. Unlike them, **DexAppBuilder** is a platform that offers **solutions for Web3 app creation**.

### The popular choice for website and blog creation in Web2: WordPress

[WordPress](https://wordpress.com/) is is one of the no-code/low-code platforms available in the market. It is an open-source CMS (Content Management System) platform. WordPress enables the easy creation and management of websites and operates within Web2.

With a significant market share, WordPress offers flexibility and a large support community. WordPress is dominating the CMS market, [reaching a 60% share](https://www.33rdsquare.com/wordpress-statistics/) of all websites in February 2024. This demonstrates the platform’s versatility and the trust developers and website owners have in it.

Due to [its open-source nature](https://github.com/WordPress), WordPress allows free access to its source code. This empowers its community to continually adapt and improve it. This feature makes WordPress a versatile and constantly updated tool for establishing an online presence.

### Advantages of WordPress

WordPress has become a popular choice for website creation due to its numerous advantages. Here are some of the key benefits that have contributed to its widespread adoption:

* **Ease of use:** WordPress offers an intuitive interface. It also provides a simple content management system. This makes it easy for users to create and manage their websites without needing extensive technical knowledge.
* **Customization:** One of WordPress’s strengths is its wide variety of themes and plugins. These allow users to customize their sites to fit their specific needs and preferences.
* **Community support:** WordPress has a large and active community. Users and developers within this community provide constant resources, support, and updates. This support network makes it easier for users to troubleshoot issues and stay updated with the latest developments.

### Disadvantages of WordPress

Despite its many advantages, WordPress also has its limitations. It’s important to be aware of these drawbacks before committing to using the platform:

* **Security problems:** WordPress websites can be vulnerable to attacks if not properly maintained and updated. Security vulnerabilities can arise from outdated software or plugins. Regular updates are essential for protecting your site from potential threats.
* **Impaired performance:** The performance of WordPress websites can suffer, particularly when overloaded with too many plugins or heavy themes. This can lead to slower loading times and a less than optimal user experience.
* **Plugin dependency:** Plugins extend WordPress site functionality. However, too many plugins cause compatibility issues, conflicts, and maintenance challenges. It’s important to carefully select and manage plugins to avoid these issues.

### The versatile website creation platform in Web2: Wix

[Wix](https://www.wix.com/) is an online website creation platform within Web2. It is also one of the no-code/low-code platforms available in the market for the Web2 environment. Wix simplifies web development through a visual drag-and-drop interface. It caters to users of all skill levels, from beginners to advanced.

The Wix platform provides customizable templates and the ability to add functions through apps. It is also popular among digital entrepreneurs for its ease of use and flexibility. Unlike WordPress, Wix operates as a cloud-based service. It offers various subscription plans, including free and paid options.

In addition to website creation, Wix entered the music world. It offers musicians a platform to distribute their music directly from their Wix website to popular streaming platforms.

While Wix offers an array of features and a user-friendly experience, it also has its limitations. Let’s explore some of the disadvantages:

* **Limited flexibility:** Wix may not provide the same level of flexibility as more advanced platforms like WordPress.
* **Performance issues:** Site speed is an important factor for SEO. Some Wix sites may experience performance issues due to excessive design elements or heavy plugins.
* **Platform dependency:** Users rely entirely on Wix for maintenance and site availability. This may result in less autonomy and control over their online presence.
