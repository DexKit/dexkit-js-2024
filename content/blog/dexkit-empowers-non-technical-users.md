Thinking of users who want to enter the world of decentralized finance without technical knowledge, DexKit has developed user-friendly technologies with universal compatibility. Users can easily deploy tools like the aggregator and NFT custom marketplace to start their decentralized projects quickly, without the need to hire professionals.

For digital entrepreneurs looking to earn passive cryptocurrencies with minimal investment, DSWAP (a powerful DEX aggregator) allows you to install it on your website and earn cryptocurrency whenever a swap occurs. It outperforms popular platforms like Uniswap by showing the best real-time prices from over thirty protocols.
