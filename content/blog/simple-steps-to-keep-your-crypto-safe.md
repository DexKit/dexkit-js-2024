There are many negative actors roaming the internet, especially on financial platforms, hence the importance of staying safe.

### 1\. Lock Down Your Password

Your password is your crypto‚Äôs first line of defense. **Keep it strong by mixing uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.** Avoid using easy-to-guess info like your name or birthday. Tip: Let a reliable password manager handle the heavy lifting for you securely.

### 2\. Double the Security Fun with 2FA

Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of protection. **It‚Äôs like having a secret handshake to keep out unwanted guests.** Receive this code on your phone or email, and you‚Äôre good to go ‚Äì you‚Äôll enhance your security. We recommend [Aegis for 2FA management](https://getaegis.app/). It‚Äôs open source and heavily secure.

### 3\. Keep Things Updated

Think of your crypto wallets like superhero suits ‚Äì they need regular upgrades. **Keep your software up-to-date to patch up any potential holes.** It‚Äôs like putting on the latest, shiniest armor against digital baddies.

### 4\. Stay Private with a VPN

Want to go incognito online? A Virtual Private Network (VPN) encrypts your activity, making it invisible to prying eyes. It‚Äôs like wearing an invisibility cloak for your crypto adventures ([ProtonVPN](https://protonvpn.com/) and [Windscribe](https://windscribe.com/) are incredible options).

### 5\. Pick the Right Wallet

Choosing a wallet is like finding a trustworthy sidekick. Go for well-known wallets, with a solid reputation. Look for features like extra layers of protection (multi-signature authentication) and a secret lair (cold storage options).

We recommend creating¬†[your very own crypto wallet with DexWallet](https://dexappbuilder.dexkit.com/admin/quick-builder/wallet)¬†attaching your email address to it, so you will have control over your assets all the time.

### 6\. Keep Your Secrets Secret

**Public Wi-Fi is like a trap set by villains.** Steer clear unless you‚Äôve got your VPN on. Remember to share sensitive info only with trusted individuals and use only well-known VPN services.

### 7\. Watch for Sneaky Phish

Phishing scams, like cat burglars in disguise, attempt to trick you into divulging sensitive information, like usernames, passwords, and credit card details. **Always double-check before handing over your info.** If it smells fishy, it probably is.

### 8\. Freeze Your Assets in Cold Storage

Think of cold storage as putting your crypto on ice ‚Äì **it‚Äôs safe from online threats.** Use a hardware wallet, and you‚Äôll be like Fort Knox for digital currency. [Trezor](https://trezor.io/), [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/) and even [metal cold wallets](https://materialbitcoin.com/producto/material-bitcoin-estandar/) are the best picks if you want to store your treasure chest.

### 9\. Backup Plans with a Seed Phrase

Forget your password? No worries ‚Äì the seed phrase is your backup plan. **Keep it as secure as a hidden treasure map.** Maybe in a safe or a top-secret location.

### 10\. Chat Privately with Encryption

When discussing secret plans (or crypto), **use encrypted messaging platforms**. It‚Äôs like having a secret language only you and your trusted allies understand. Some examples are¬†[Keybase](http://keybase.io), [Signal](https://signal.org/), [Session](https://getsession.org/), and yes, even WhatsApp provides encryption for your chats.

### 11\. Check in on Your Crypto

Give your crypto a regular check-up. Any weird activity? Change your password and activate 2FA soon. It‚Äôs like a superhero health check for your digital assets.

You can even also revoke old permissions in your wallet using [Revoke service](https://revoke.cash/). This will help you to keep your wallets even safer without old / deprecated / suspicious authorizations.

### 12\. Play Defense with Regular Audits

Do a security audit now and then ‚Äì it‚Äôs like tightening the screws on your superhero suit. Fix any weak spots before they become entry points for super-villains.

And there you have it ‚Äì 12 simple steps to keep your crypto safe and sound. Now go out there and be the superhero your digital assets deserve! ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
