During our relentless daily efforts to advance our project, we virtually participated in the [Next.js 2022 conference](https://nextjs.org/conf), sponsored by [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), held in San Francisco, California. The event exceeded expectations in terms of capacity and delivered invaluable content and announcements.

One groundbreaking announcement made during the conference was the release of Next.js 13. This update addresses critical concerns for developers, including web app responsiveness, 24/7 availability, compatibility with DeFi tools, and innovative features that revolutionize project development and maintenance.
