#### The Birth of Emojis and Their Rise

The World's First Emoji Set: SoftBank, known as J-Phone at the time, releases the SkyWalker DP-211SW mobile phone on the 1st of November 1997, with the world's first known emoji set.

Emojis originated in the late 20th century as pictorial representations in electronic communication. Over time, their popularity surged, transcending borders and cultures. The inclusion of emojis in the Unicode Standard played a pivotal role in their global adoption, ensuring their compatibility across devices and platforms. World Emoji Day, celebrated on July 17th, marks their significance and highlights their impact on modern communication

#### Emojis and Emotional Connection

In an era where face-to-face interactions have been replaced by digital conversations, emojis have emerged as powerful tools for emotional expression. They possess the unique ability to convey sentiment, humor, and empathy, bridging the gap between written language and non-verbal cues. By incorporating emojis, individuals can establish a deeper connection with others, even in the absence of physical proximity.

Walther and D‚ÄôAddario study found that Emoticons were found to have little impact on message interpretations. The study also found that negative emoticons made both positive and negative statements being rated more negative. The use of positive emoticons also made someone being perceived as more agreeable, more open, and more conscientious. Kalyanaraman and Ivory (2012) conducted a study about the effects of emoticons on impression formation, affect, and cognition in chat transcript. It was found that the use of emoticon made someone being perceived as more friendly and competent. (ResearchGate, 2023)

#### Emojis and Investment Communication

Beyond their role in personal communication, emojis have made their way into the world of investments. In recent years, the use of emojis in company communications and investor relations has gained traction. Some companies have creatively incorporated emojis in their financial reports and social media posts to engage with shareholders and investors. Emojis, when used judiciously, can add personality, clarity, and relatability to corporate communications, potentially enhancing investor engagement.

#### The SEC's Stance on Emojis

However, it‚Äôs essential to note that emojis in investment communications have faced scrutiny. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued guidelines to companies regarding the use of emojis and other non-GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) metrics. The SEC aimed to ensure that the use of emojis did not mislead investors or obscure critical financial information. This regulatory intervention reflects the growing importance of emojis in investment communication and the need for responsible usage in a regulated environment.

When used appropriately, emojis can enhance investor engagement by adding visual appeal and humanizing corporate communications. Emojis, strategically placed, can convey enthusiasm, emphasize key points, or provide subtle context, helping to capture the attention of stakeholders and enhance message retention. In an era where information overload is a constant challenge, emojis can be a valuable tool for companies to stand out and foster a connection with investors and the overall community.
