Undoubtedly, 2022 has been a year that many would prefer to erase from their personal history. The global events have sent shockwaves through the financial markets, causing even seemingly strong and stable projects to crumble.

As participants in this fiercely competitive industry, it’s impossible not to feel fear and uncertainty in the face of such conditions, where even the next big player’s downfall is unknown. Unfortunately, the collapse of a major project often brings down smaller ones with it, leaving in its wake the devastation of livelihoods for hundreds of individuals who dedicated their time and effort to support what turned out to be a fragile house of cards.

Against all odds, we have weathered the worst economic storms of this year, thanks to a supportive community that continuously encourages us to develop new solutions and enhance our existing products. They have witnessed firsthand our journey to the present day and have inspired us to go the extra mile to improve [our stellar offering](https://whitelabel-nft.dexkit.com/).

However, let’s not pretend that everything is perfect or that we have tens of thousands of users extensively testing our products and services. Why deceive you? We are a small project within a vast ecosystem comprising larger entities with numerous employees and resources. We acknowledge our reality as a small business and remain focused on [creating purpose-driven products](https://docs.dexkit.com/welcome/the-startup/mission-vision-and-values). Our aim is not cutthroat competition but rather a healthy environment that fosters growth and acknowledges the efforts of those deserving.

Looking ahead to 2023, we anticipate a promising year for the crypto ecosystem as a whole. The multitude of products developed in the past two years, coupled with the resilience that arises from economic debacles, hacks on decentralized protocols, and even the downfall of major entities, will contribute to the ecosystem’s healing and fortification. Through innovative ideas, these challenges have given rise to adoption, creating a robust foundation for growth.

In the realm of DexKit, we have spent over two and a half years doing much more than building a project. We have helped our community not only understand decentralized finance but also distributed wealth to our most loyal members, staying true [to the roadmap](https://www.dexkit.com/roadmap/) outlined during the genesis of the project in 2020. And we will continue this journey throughout 2023.

As the new year approaches, we wish for your most cherished dreams to come true and for unity to always prevail among your loved ones.

**Sincerely,  
The DexKit Core Team.**
