### OKC Blockchain: The Newest Integration on the Horizon

We are thrilled to announce that DexKit is dedicating hours of development to integrate the¬†[OKC chain](https://www.okx.com/okc)¬†into SuperApp. This integration will allow OKC network holders to effortlessly manage their crypto assets through a lightweight and intelligent DeFi dashboard.

We share a lot of goals with OKC: security, smart contracts development and builders instinct ‚õèÔ∏è

Furthermore, we anticipate that DexKit prediction games will soon be available on the OKC network, fostering a deeper relationship between the two projects. While the full integration is underway and may take a few days due to necessary changes and testing by our developers, users can already enjoy managing OKC chain ERC20 tokens directly from SuperApp.

DexKit envisions a collaborative advertising campaign with OKC, wherein the project will be introduced to the OKC community across various social platforms. Our goal is to establish a strong brand presence in the Asian markets.

### Avalanche and Fantom Networks: Seamless Integration with SuperApp

At DexKit, we value the power of numbers and recognize the demand for top-notch DeFi products among users of EVM networks. With this in mind, we have added the efficient Avalanche and versatile Fantom blockchains as native options within the SuperApp platform.
