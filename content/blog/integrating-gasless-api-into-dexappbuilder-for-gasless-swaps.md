At DexKit, **our mission is to make Web3 accessible**. One of the many ways we do this is by simplifying decentralized trading for everyone. Today, we‚Äôre thrilled to announce the **integration of the Gasless API into our DexAppBuilder platform** for white label DEX swap aggregators. This groundbreaking feature is designed to eliminate gas fees in token swaps. It benefits a wide array of users across the DexKit community. From traders and developers to NFT artists, cryptocurrency enthusiasts, and DApp creators, this integration marks a significant step towards democratizing DeFi. It expands opportunities within the decentralized ecosystem.

#### What is the Gasless API?

The [Gasless API](https://0x.org/post/0x-101-intro-to-gasless-api) simplifies ERC-20 token trading by eliminating the need to hold native tokens for gas fees. Provided by [0x](https://0x.org/), this API allows users to access liquidity, prices, and quotes effortlessly. Upon agreeing to a quote, users sign an EIP-712 message. This enables the API to handle approvals and submit transactions on their behalf, covering the gas fees.

#### Gasless API Key Features

Below are the key features of the Gasless API. They make this API the right choice for cost-effective and user-friendly decentralized finance (DeFi) transactions across multiple blockchain networks.

*   **Gasless transactions:** Execute token swaps without paying gas fees. Utilize a portion of the input token for transaction fees.
*   **Gasless approvals:** Utilize EIP-712 messages for gasless ERC-20 token allowances. This eliminates upfront gas expenses.
*   **MEV bot protection:** Gasless API incorporates MEV bot protection. This reduces trade failures and prevents sandwich bot interference.
*   **Multi-network support:** Gasless swaps are accessible across Ethereum, Polygon, Optimism, and Arbitrum networks.

#### How the Gasless API works

With the Gasless API, users experience smooth and cost-effective trading. Here‚Äôs how it works:

*   **Quote and approval:** Users first receive a quote for the transaction. If they agree to the terms, they sign an EIP-712 message to approve the transaction.
*   **Transaction submission:** The Gasless API then submits the transaction on behalf of the user, covering all gas fees.
*   **Confirmation and completion:** Users receive a confirmation once the transaction is successfully processed, completing the trade without any gas fee worries.
