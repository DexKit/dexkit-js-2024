At DexKit, we prioritize digital entrepreneurs who inspire others with their creative ideas and drive to explore the world of cryptocurrencies. Our tools are designed to empower these entrepreneurs, giving them complete ownership, control, and management over their digital creations.

The latest update of our White Label NFT marketplace introduces a wide range of new features, including **enhanced customizations**, **bug fixes**, **and improved compatibility with the most popular EVM networks**. We’ve also evolved to include compatibility for ERC 1155 tokens, which have become an industry standard due to their efficiency and additional functionality compared to ERC 721 contracts traditionally used by developers for NFT projects

### What benefits does deploying your NFT Marketplace offer to digital entrepreneurs?

**First and foremost, you don’t need to design, mint, or own NFTs in order to earn fees when NFTs are sold on your white label marketplace.** As a creator, if you list NFTs such as Bored Ape Yacht Club, popular Reddit NFTs, or any other NFTs on your marketplace, **you’ll receive the fees of your choosing when they sell.**

If you find that the fees you initially set are too low considering the effort you’ve invested in creating your marketplace, you can easily edit them to your preference. However, **it’s important to strike a balance, as excessively high fees may discourage potential buyers.** We recommend keeping the NFT marketplace fees between 1% and 3%, and around 1% for the trading widget.

### Regarding network compatibility

We are continuously expanding compatibility with EVM networks, particularly those supported by the well-known [0x project](https://0x.org/), which is the foundation of our tools and solutions.

### Will the code still be open source after this update?

Absolutely! We will continue to make our code publicly available on [our Github repository](https://github.com/DexKit/open-nft-marketplace), as the core purpose of our project is to provide cutting-edge software for free. We want people to have access to these state-of-the-art solutions, enabling them to enter the decentralized finance market under our name and the banner of our startup.

### Will DexKit offer a premium version to the public?

Yes, we’re currently developing a premium subscription that **will offer additional options and features not available in the free version**. While we haven’t decided on the launch date for this premium version as we are still in the beta phase, we will keep our community updated once a decision is made.

We are actively seeking partners and sponsors to help us enhance our open source technologies, ensuring that we can continue to deliver simple and effective solutions to entrepreneurs.

Learn more about the new updates:

* * **Simplified market deployment:** You only need an email address to begin the deployment process. This user-friendly wizard will guide you through the necessary steps.

* * **Enhanced customizations:** Users can now add customizable pages with text blocks, headers, images, videos, code sections, and other resources. Additionally, it’s now possible to include a static header and footer on your NFT marketplace, featuring your social media links.

* * **Bug fixes:** As a beta tool, we encountered some minor bugs during the production process, all of which have been resolved. We have also improved compatibility with framework libraries, making the application scalable. Ongoing collaboration with other developers will contribute to further improvements over time.

* * **Free domain for your NFT marketplace:** When you deploy your NFT marketplace for the first time and complete all the required options, you will receive a direct link to your NFT marketplace with a `name-of-marketplace.dexkit.app` suffix. This eliminates the need for creating a CNAME on a domain for routing purposes.

* * **Centralized hosting for media resources:** In the previous version of the white-label NFT marketplace, users had to provide their own image links. This is no longer necessary.

* * **Enhanced SEO and faster load times:** Your marketplace will now be indexed by search engines, increasing its exposure. We utilize the latest React and Next.js frameworks to ensure exceptional speed for all marketplaces.

We remain committed to creating remarkable DeFi tools, regardless of market conditions! 🤓

Moreover, we haven’t forgotten about our beloved [Coin League game](https://coinleague.com/). We’re currently working on a major update that will allow you to play for free, without incurring any network fees.
