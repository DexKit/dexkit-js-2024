With the tremendous popularity of games like [Axie Infinity](https://axieinfinity.com/) (which introduced scholarship opportunities) and [Gods Unchained](https://godsunchained.com/) (currently the most popular Trading Card game) among others, the gaming landscape has undergone a dramatic transformation.

One of the dozens of reasons why Steam is capable of restricting functionality to users ‚ö†

Popular platforms like¬†[Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/)¬†and¬†[Epic Games](https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/home), unfortunately, do not allow average users (non-professional players) to profit from the items they acquire during their extensive gameplay sessions. Moreover, these platforms enforce strict Terms of Service, which can result in access bans.

To bridge the gap between players‚Äô efforts (time spent and skills) and their real earnings, decentralized finance has emerged. It grants users true ownership of their in-game assets, providing a solution to the existing disparity.

Now, let‚Äôs explore the most prevalent genres of blockchain games.

#### Trading card games

These games involve collecting, trading, and playing with unique digital trading cards stored on a blockchain. Examples include the aforementioned Axie Infinity and Gods Unchained.

#### Collectible games

Similar to trading card games, collectible games revolve around acquiring, trading, and playing with unique digital collectibles stored on a blockchain. Some notable examples include¬†[CryptoKitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co/)¬†and¬†[NBA Top Shot](https://nbatopshot.com/).

#### Decentralized finance games

These games incorporate elements of decentralized finance (DeFi), such as yield farming, staking, and liquidity provision. One significant advantage of these games is the transparency provided by blockchain transactions, enabling a better understanding of the underlying processes.

#### Virtual world games

In virtual world games built on a blockchain, players have the freedom to create, own, trade, and interact within these digital realms. These ‚Äúmetaverses‚Äù offer hundreds of adventures and quests, fostering strong connections between the project and its users. Examples include¬†[The Sandbox](https://www.sandbox.game/en/),¬†[Somnium Space](https://somniumspace.com/), and¬†[Decentraland](https://decentraland.org/).

#### Multiplayer online games

These games allow players to compete with others in multiplayer environments that utilize blockchain technology for player data, asset ownership, and in-game transactions.¬†[Our very own Coin League game](https://coinleague.com/)¬†perfectly exemplifies this genre.

We couldn‚Äôt ignore this burgeoning industry, as¬†we firmly believe that the future of digital ownership lies within it.

Our debut blockchain game is about to receive a substantial update, which could position it as one of the best in its genre. We‚Äôll explain why, but first, let‚Äôs refresh your understanding of our game üëá

[Coin League](https://coinleague.com) is a decentralized, blockchain-based game that allows players to compete in races where the prize pools are denominated in cryptocurrency and held in smart contracts on the Polygon and Binance chains.¬†This unique concept combines elements of gaming and decentralized finance, enabling players to earn real-world value while enjoying the game.

Our game is a hidden gem in the Play to Learn (P2L) gaming concept, which aims to educate and raise awareness about decentralized finance (DeFi) and blockchain technology.¬†Coin League incorporates a competition and reward system alongside educational content, allowing players to comprehend and learn about DeFi, blockchain, asset prices, and time patterns.

The main goal of Play to Learn games is to make learning about these complex topics enjoyable and accessible to a broader audience.

Coin League also integrates¬†[Chainlink](https://chain.link)¬†technology to ensure it remains impervious to hackers, cheaters, and malicious actors. Cryptocurrency prices are safeguarded by decentralized Oracles, and each match is an immutable Smart Contract that automatically rewards winners at the end of the timer.

Regarding the upcoming major update for the game, it will introduce a completely free mode for players to become acquainted with the game before opting for the Pro version.
