### Why did we add AI integration to DexAppBuilder?

We’ve noticed that many digital creators and entrepreneurs struggle to deliver quality content on time due to a lack of creativity, language skills, the high cost of quality generative tools, among other factors. This integration **provides them with a “companion” that supports them during the creative processes** involved in onchain application design, offering a powerful and always available tool.

### Who is this integration for?

This integration is designed for digital creators and entrepreneurs who don’t need to be an expert in design or copywriting to achieve remarkable results. In general terms, any DexAppBuilder user can benefit from this tool, which stimulates their creativity and assists them in generating rich content tailored to the specific needs of their project.

### Regarding the cost of this tool

Using generative AI functions incurs a cost for the project since it involves calls to an external API (OpenAI’s). Thus, each call results in a charge that must be covered to maintain the service. We have set up a straightforward checkout page where users can pre-load their consumption (from $5 to $100) in various cryptocurrencies and blockchain networks.
