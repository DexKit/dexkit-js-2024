Hey there, DeFinauts! 🐱‍🚀🙋‍♂️If you’re new to our cool products, you might not know about our [super-efficient DEX aggregator](https://swap.dexkit.com) built a long time ago. We made it by taking ideas from Uniswap v2 and adding a super-smart routing system that can go toe-to-toe with any top platform.

We kicked off a project that allows users to create personalized versions of the DEX aggregator, using our white-label product inspired by Uniswap v2’s design. Many crypto enthusiasts have embraced this feature, depending on our system for their everyday business activities. This has helped us amass an impressive API volume, simultaneously benefiting everyone who used it for their operations, whether directly through our link or via any white-label solution crafted with our tools.

As time went by and we saw a need for more decentralized finance tools on our platform, **our team decided to make this product even better**. We focused on how it works, how easy it is to set up, and keeping everything running smoothly by following the best ways to build with scalable code.

Now, you can make your version of the aggregator super easily with the [DexAppBuilder platform](https://dexappbuilder.dexkit.com/admin/quick-builder/swap), which has many user-friendly decentralized tools.

The new and improved integration makes it easy to set up your own efficient DEX aggregator and **makes the experience that much better for people who are using it right from the start**. Neither you nor your clients have to download huge ERC 20 wallets or pay for hosting or website names because DexKit provides them for free. Also, the DEX aggregator now works with all the most popular networks (Ethereum, BNB chain, Polygon, Avalanche, Fantom, Optimism, and Arbitrum), so you can trade on many different platforms.

**We’re super excited about the DEX aggregator** 🥳 we think it’ll be a big help to anyone who gives it a try. It’s a fast and reliable tool that makes sure you –and your clients– to get the best price for every trade. And the best part is, we made it with the smartest methods, so you know it’s a trustworthy tool for everyone.
