In the [Web3](https://dexkit.com/web3-the-present-and-the-future-of-the-internet/) era, [no-code/low-code platforms](https://dexkit.com/no-code-low-code-revolution-transforming-digital-creation/)  are crucial for developers and app creators. They bridge the gap between users and complex technologies like blockchain. These platforms make on-chain application development easier.  Consequently, they democratize the process for both coding-savvy and non-technical users. This enables them to participate in the decentralized ecosystem with ease.

An on-chain application, also called a [decentralized application (dApp)](https://dexkit.com/the-power-of-decentralized-applications-dapps/), works directly on a blockchain network. These apps use the decentralized nature of blockchain for different functions like smart contracts, DeFi, NFTs, and more. “On-chain” indicates that the blockchain stores and runs the app’s logic and data. This ensures transparency, security, and immutability.
